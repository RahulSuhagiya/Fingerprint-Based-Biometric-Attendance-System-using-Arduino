# Fingerprint-Based-Biometric-Attendance-System-using-Arduino
Attendance systems are commonly used systems to mark the presence in offices and schools. From  manually marking the attendance in attendance registers to using high-tech applications and biometric systems, these systems have improved significantly. In this project, I used fingerprint Module and Arduino to take and keep attendance data and records. By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. The circuit of this fingerprint based attendance system project, It has Arduino for controlling all the process of the project, push button for enrolling, deleting, selecting IDs and for attendance, a buzzer for alerting, LEDs for indication and LCD to instruct user and showing the resultant messages.
